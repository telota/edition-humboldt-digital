                <p>This module contains unpublished documents from Humboldt’s papers, held primarily
                    in the Berlin State Library and the Jagiellonian Library in Krakow. Through five
                    thematic sections, the edition offers insights into Humboldt’s research
                    practices before and after his travels. It documents ways in which he collected
                    data and connected different areas of inquiry with each other.</p>

                <p>Humboldt started his investigations in the field of plant geography by asking
                    questions about the connection between the history of plants and that of
                    mankind. During his American journey, Humboldt developed the concept of plant
                    physiognomy: Main morphological forms determine the character of different types
                    of vegetation. In the “Tableau physique des Andes et pays voisins”, which was
                    also designed during the journey, the geography of plants is part of a global
                    geoscientific research project. During the 1820s, Humboldt developed the
                    numerical method of botanical arithmetic. This concept, as well as
                    the–ultimately abandoned–project of a <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/themen/detail.xql?id=H0002731&amp;l=en">new edition of his “Essai sur la Géographie des plantes”</ref>, were part
                    of a broader vision of plant geography on a global scale. </p>
                <p>Humboldt’s papers contain numerous unpublished manuscripts and correspondences
                    (including those with <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/briefe/index.xql?person=H0006403&amp;l=en">Karl Ludwig Willdenow</ref> and <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/briefe/index.xql?person=H0001517&amp;l=en">Carl Sigismund Kunth</ref>) on plant geography, which were published in

                <p>Virtually all traveling naturalists of the time referred to Humboldt and his
                    travel account. Humboldt, in return, advised and supported many travelers.
                    Research institutions compiled travel instructions, which also corresponded to
                    Humboldt’s ideal of comprehensive collection and note-taking practices. At the
                    same time, however, the natural sciences – and travelers with them – were
                    becoming increasingly specialised. The result was a tension between (Humboldt’s)
                    ideal of traveling and how travel was being practised, which Humboldt and others
                    saw critically and commented on.</p>
                <head type="sub">How did the relationship develop between the travelers and the
                    scholars, administrators and curators who stayed at home?</head>
                <p>Due to an increasing separation between researchers who collected data in the
                    field and those who scientifically evaluated the objects and data at home,
                    Humboldt often communicated between travelers and their patrons, pre-published
                    findings on behalf of absent researchers and mediated the exchange, lending and
                    sale of collection objects throughout Europe. In this sense, <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/themen/forschungsreisen.xql?l=en">the
                        thematic section Scientific Travels</ref> is connected to the history of
                    objects and follows the traces of Humboldt’s work as a mediator – for example in
                    Berlin collections.</p>

                <p>During his American journey, Humboldt recognized a connection between aesthetics
                    and science. His <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/X0000017">correspondence with Johann Moritz Rugendas</ref>
                    shows how he communicated his concept to a new generation of landscape painters
                    traveling to America.</p>

                    was the last scientific project Humboldt supported by means of his reputation
                    and influence. The brothers undertook their expedition at a time of profound
                    epistemological transformation in the areas of field research and the study of
                    foreign cultures. Humboldt’s correspondence with the Schlagintweit brothers
                    documents a paradigm shift in media history from natural painting to
                    photography. The extensive collections of the Schlagintweits were initially
                    intended, with Alexander von Humboldt's support, for a planned Indian Museum in
                    Berlin's Monbijou Palace, but soon became the object of dispute between British
                    colonial authorities and the Prussian museum administration.</p>

                <p>He compared the structure of the earth’s crust as well as the strike and dip of
                    mountains and volcanic arcs across the globe to establish common patterns and
                    understand the laws of nature. Humboldt pursued the same goal in his
                    investigations of the atmosphere and the global distribution of mean temperature
                    zones.</p>
                <p>Humboldt's papers in the Berlin State Library contain numerous unpublished
                    manuscripts, which can shed new light on Humboldt's geognostic hypotheses:
                    Immediately after the American Journey he carried out chemical experiments on
                    the composition of the atmosphere with Louis-Jacques Thénard and Joseph
                    Gay-Lussac (“Absorption de l’oxygène par les terres humectées”; “Expériments sur
                    l’air atmosphérique”, <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-HS-1280521">Papers Large Box
                        8</ref>). These experiments can be seen as a continuation of his
                    observations on air purity and the assumed connection with the spread of
                    epidemic diseases (especially yellow fever), which Humboldt had recorded a few
                    months earlier in New Spain and Cuba (“C'est mon cahier de la Havane intitulé
                    sur la salubrité de l'air”, 28 fols., <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-HS-2849282">Vol. 1 of the Krakow
                        Papers</ref>).</p>
                <p>During the 1820s, Humboldt composed numerous manuscripts in preparation of his
                        <hi rendition="#i">Geognostische Versuche über die Ausbreitung der
                        Gebirgsarten in beiden Erdhälften</hi> (1823). The “Examen des hypothèses
                    géologiques considérées dans le rapport de leur concordance avec les principes
                    de la Mécanique, de la Physique et de la Chimie” (over thirty pages long) (<ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-HS-1035140">Papers Large Box
                        5</ref>) deals among other things with writings on thermodynamics by Joseph
                    Fourier and Siméon Denis Poisson. The <ref target="http://archiv.bbaw.de/archiv/archivbestaende/abteilung-nachlasse/nachlasse/humboldt_alexander">archives of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities</ref>
                    hold a copy of the French edition of the <hi rendition="#i">Geognostische
                        Versuche, </hi>interleaved with numerous handwritten notes. </p>
                <p>Following the Russian-Siberian journey, Humboldt intensively dealt with the
                    geology and climatology of the Asian continent. A first result was an Academy
                    lecture held in January 1831 in Paris, entitled “Sur quelques phénomènes
                    physiques et géognostiques de l'Asie au nord de parallèle de 50 degrés” (<ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-HS-1035153">Papers Large Box
                        5</ref>), which will be published for the first time in the <hi rendition="#i">edition humboldt digital</hi>. Here, too, Humboldt's research
                    reveals itself to be a science on the move: “La description du globe n'est point
                    une science stationnaire” [The physical description of the Earth is not a
                    stationary science].</p>

                <p>The two atlases of the American travel account are based on earlier map series by
                    American and European cartographers, which Humboldt used as points of reference.
                    While working on his atlases, Humboldt was in contact with American (José Manuel
                    Restrepo, Joaquín Acosta) and European (Adrian-Hubert Brué, Pierre Lapie,
                    Jean-Baptiste Joseph Delambre) cartographers, draughtsmen and engravers.This
                    exchange is richly documented in <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-BF-42736">Volume 7</ref> and

                    the Krakow papers and will be comprehensively covered in this thematic
                        section.</p>
                <p>As a historian of the geographical exploration of the American continent by
                    Europeans, Humboldt recognised the value of the early modern maps of America as
                    historical sources. His investigations into the history of cartography, as
                    documented in the manuscripts and sketches of <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-BF-42738">Volume 9</ref> of the
                    Krakow papers, are another focus of the thematic section.</p>

                <p>Documents, transcripts, notes and correspondence regarding a "history of the
                    world view", as Humboldt himself names various envelopes, can be found
                    especially in the <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-BF-12815">Large Box 8</ref> of the Berlin papers. It contains materials on the
                    natural philosophy of the Egyptians, Greeks and Chinese, on the prehistory of
                    the Phoenicians, on the history of Sanskrit and Indian philosophy as well as on
                    the early history of globalization in the context of the European conquest of
                    the American continent.</p>
                <p>Humboldt’s historical interpretation of the age of European discoveries and the
                    early phase of Ibero-American colonialism has also left its traces in the Krakow
                    estate. Adding to the materials from the thematic section on the history of
                    discovery and cartography, Humboldt proves to have a scholarly interest in
                    American linguistic diversity. Here, the research interests of the two Humboldt
                    Brothers correspond. Alexander collects materials on North and Mesoamerican
                    linguistic and cultural history as well as information on the archaeology of
                    early American civilizations, which he then compares to the history of the
                    so-called Orient (above all Egypt) and the cultures of East Asia.</p>
                <p>In the first volume of his <hi rendition="#i">Kosmos</hi>, Humboldt coined a now
                    well-known sentence that emphasized the unity of the human race: "In maintaining
                    the unity of the human kind, we at the same time repudiate all the
                    unsatisfactory assumptions of higher and lower races of men. There are races of
                    men more flexible, more highly polished, through mental culture more ennobled,
                    but none naturally more noble. All are in equal measure ordained for liberty;
                    for liberty which in ruder conditions of society appertains to the individual,
                    which in more polished state, in civil life and among men in the enjoyment of
                    political institutions, is the right of the community." Humboldt’s findings on
                    the cultures of humankind, as expressed for example in the <hi rendition="#i">Vues des Cordillères et monumens des peuples indigènes de l'Amérique</hi>
                    published in 1810–1813, as well as his studies on slavery and the plantation
                    economy, which were initiated in particular by his experiences on the American
                    journey, are oriented towards this conviction. Both the Krakow (especially <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-BF-42729">volumes 1–3</ref>) and
                    Berlin papers (especially <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-BF-12629">Large Box 2</ref> and

                <p> Am Beginn seiner Überlegungen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen standen Fragen
                    nach der Verbundenheit von Pflanzen- und Menschheitsgeschichte. Auf der
                    amerikanischen Reise entwickelte Humboldt das Konzept der Pflanzenphysiognomik,
                    demzufolge morphologische Hauptformen in ihren jeweiligen Anteilen den Charakter
                    verschiedener Vegetationstypen bestimmen. Im ebenfalls bereits auf der Reise
                    entworfenen <hi rendition="#i">Naturgemälde der Tropenländer</hi> wurde die
                    Geographie der Pflanzen zum Teil eines weltumspannenden geowissenschaftlichen
                    Forschungsprojekts. Der Plan einer Pflanzengeographie der ganzen Erde lag auch
                    Humboldts Arbeiten zum numerischen Verfahren der botanischen Arithmetik und dem
                    – schließlich aufgegebenen – Vorhaben einer <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/themen/detail.xql?id=H0002731">Neuausgabe seiner </ref><ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/themen/detail.xql?id=H0002731"><hi rendition="#i">Ideen zu einer Geographie der Pflanzen</hi></ref>

                <p>Zwar beriefen sich praktisch alle reisenden Naturforscher der Zeit auf Humboldt
                    und dessen Reisewerk, viele von ihnen beriet und förderte er.
                    Forschungseinrichtungen verfassten Instruktionen für wissenschaftliche Reisende,
                    die ebenfalls dem Humboldt’schen Ideal einer möglichst umfassenden Sammel- und
                    Aufzeichnungspraxis entsprachen. Zugleich aber spezialisierten sich die
                    Naturwissenschaften – und mit ihnen die Reisenden. Es entstand ein
                    Spannungsverhältnis zwischen (Humboldt’schem) Reiseideal und Reisepraxis, das
                    auch Humboldt kommentierte. </p>
                <head type="sub">Wie entwickelte sich das Verhältnis zwischen den Reisenden und den
                    zu Hause gebliebenen Gelehrten, Administratoren und Kuratoren? </head>
                <p>Angesichts einer zunehmenden personellen Trennung der Sammlungstätigkeit im Feld
                    und der wissenschaftlichen Auswertung vermittelte Humboldt häufig zwischen
                    Reisenden und ihren Auftraggebern, veröffentlichte im Namen abwesender Forscher
                    erste Ergebnisse und vermittelte europaweit den Tausch, Verleih und Verkauf von
                    Sammlungsobjekten. Hier schlägt der <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/themen/forschungsreisen.xql?l=de">Themenschwerpunkt Forschungsreisen</ref> thematisch eine Brücke zur
                    Objektgeschichte und folgt den Spuren Humboldt’scher Mittlertätigkeit – etwa in
                    Berliner Sammlungen. </p>
                <p>Bereits digital veröffentlicht wurde 2019 <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/H0016785">Christian Gottfried Ehrenbergs
                        Tagebuch der russisch-sibirischen Reise</ref> mit Humboldt (1829), das
                    zahlreiche Verweise auf zoologische und <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/register/pflanzen/index.xql?id=H0016785">botanische Spezimina</ref> enthält, die an Berliner und Pariser Sammlungen
                    gingen. </p>
                <p>Bereits auf seiner eigenen amerikanischen Reise hatte Humboldt das Ideal einer
                    Verbindung zwischen Ästhetik und Wissenschaft entworfen. Sein <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/X0000017">Briefwechsel mit
                        Johann Moritz
                        Rugendas</ref> zeigt exemplarisch, wie Humboldt sein Konzept an eine neue
                    Generation nach Amerika reisender Landschaftsmaler vermittelte. </p>
                <p>Die Indien- und Himalayareise <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/briefe/index.xql?person=H0015552&amp;l=de">Adolph</ref>, <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/briefe/index.xql?person=H0015557&amp;l=de">Hermann</ref> und <ref target="https://edition-humboldt.de/briefe/index.xql?person=H0015556&amp;l=de">Robert</ref> Schlagintweits (1854–1858) war das letzte große Förderprojekt
                    Alexander von Humboldts. Die Brüder unternahmen ihre Expeditionen im Moment
                    eines tiefgreifenden epistemologischen Umbruchs in der empirischen Feldforschung
                    und dem Studium fremder Kulturen. Der Schlagintweit-Briefwechsel, der sich im
                    Wesentlichen über die Bearbeitung der Berliner und Münchner Bestände erschließt,
                    verweist im Anschluss an den Rugendas-Briefwechsel auf einen medienhistorischen
                    Paradigmenwechsel vom Naturgemälde zur Fotografie. Waren die umfangreichen
                    Sammlungen der Schlagintweits zunächst und mit Unterstützung Alexander von
                    Humboldts für ein geplantes Indisches Museum im Berliner Schloss Monbijou
                    vorgesehen, so wurden sie rasch zum Streitobjekt zwischen britischen
                    Kolonialbehörden und der preußischen Museumsverwaltung. </p>

                    Vulkanketten weltweit, um Mustern und Gesetzmäßigkeiten auf die Spur zu kommen.
                    Dieses Ziel verfolgte Humboldt auch bei seinen Untersuchungen zur Atmosphäre und
                    mittleren Temperaturverteilungen der Erde. </p>
                <p>In Humboldts Nachlass in der Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin finden sich zahlreiche
                    unveröffentlichte Schriften, deren forschende Edition ein neues Licht auf
                    Humboldts hypothesengeleitete Erdwissenschaft werfen wird. Dazu gehören
                    unmittelbar nach der Reise 1804 in Paris mit Louis-Jacques Thénard und Joseph
                    Gay-Lussac durchgeführte chemische Experimente zur Zusammensetzung der
                    Atmosphäre (“Absorption de l’oxygène par les terres humectées”; “Expériments sur
                    l’air atmosphérique”, <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-HS-1280521">gr. Kasten 8</ref>).
                    Diese Versuche können als Fortsetzung seiner Beobachtungen zur Reinheit der Luft
                    und dem von ihm angenommenen Zusammenhang mit der Ausbreitung epidemische
                    Krankheiten (vor allem Gelbfieber) gesehen werden, die Humboldt wenige Monate
                    zuvor in Neu-Spanien und auf Kuba niedergeschrieben hatte (“C'est mon cahier de
                    la Havane intitulé sur la salubrité de l'air”, 28 Bl., <ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-HS-2849282">Bd. 1 im Krakauer
                        Nachlass</ref>). </p>
                <p>In den 1820er Jahren entstanden im Umfeld der Arbeit am <hi rendition="#i">Geognostischen Versuch über die Ausbreitung der Gebirgsarten in beiden
                        Erdhälften</hi> (1823) zahlreiche bislang unveröffentlichte Manuskripte. Der
                    über dreißig Seiten lange “Examen des hypothèses géologiques considérées dans le
                    rapport de leur concordance avec les principes de la Mécanique, de la Physique
                    et de la Chimie” (<ref target="http://kalliope-verbund.info/DE-611-HS-1035140">gr. Kasten 5</ref>) setzt sich unter anderem mit Schriften zur
                    Thermodynamik von Joseph Fourier und Siméon Denis Poisson auseinander. Ein mit
                    zahlreichen handschriftlichen Anmerkungen durchschossenes Handexemplar der
                    französischen Ausgabe des <hi rendition="#i">Geognostischen Versuchs

                <p>Im Anschluss an die russisch-sibirische Reise setzte sich Humboldt intensiv mit
                    der Geologie und Klimatologie des asiatischen Kontinents auseinander. Ein erstes
                    Ergebnis war der im Januar 1831 in Paris gehaltene Akademievortrag „Sur quelques
                    phénomènes physiques et géognostiques de l’Asie au nord de parallèle de 50

                    Globalisierung im Kontext der europäischen Eroberung des amerikanischen
                    Kontinents. </p>
                <p>Humboldts kultur- und wissenschaftshistorischer Blick auf das Zeitalter der
                    europäischen Entdeckungen und der Frühphase des iberoamerikanischen
                    Kolonialismus zeigt sich auch im Krakauer Nachlass. In Ergänzung zu den
                    Materialien aus dem Themenschwerpunkt Entdeckungsgeschichte und Kartographie
                    erweist sich Humboldt hier als Erforscher der amerikanischen Sprachenvielfalt.
                    Er erkennt im Studium der Sprachen der Welt den Ausdruck einer Vielfalt der
                    Weltkulturen. Hier kommen die Forschungsinteressen der beiden Humboldt-Brüder in
                    besonderer Weise in Berührung: Materialien zur nord- und mesoamerikanischen
                    Sprach- und Kulturgeschichte interessieren Alexander ebenso wie Studien zur
                    Archäologie der amerikanischen Hochkulturen, die er immer im Sinne einer
                    vergleichenden Anthropologie in Beziehung setzt zur Geschichte des sogenannten
                    Orients (v.a. Ägypten) und den Kulturen Ostasiens.</p>
                <p>Mit Blick auf die Einheit des Menschengeschlechts prägt Humboldt im ersten Band
                    des Kosmos die berühmte Sentenz: “Indem wir die Einheit des Menschengeschlechtes
                    behaupten, widerstreben wir auch jeder unerfreulichen Annahme von höheren und
                    niederen Menschenracen. Es giebt bildsamere, höhere gebildete, durch geistige
                    Cultur veredelte, aber keine edleren Volksstämme. Alle sind gleichmäßig zur
                    Freiheit bestimmt; zur Freiheit, welche in roheren Zuständen dem Einzelnen, in
                    dem Staatenleben bei dem Genuß politischer Institutionen der Gesammtheit als
                    Berechtigung zukommt.” Diese Überzeugung orientiert Humboldts
                    kulturanthropologische Forschungen, wie sie etwa in den 1810–1813 publizierten
                        <hi rendition="#i">Vues des Cordillères et monumens des peuples indigènes de
                        l’Amérique</hi> zum Ausdruck kommen, genauso wie seine besonders durch die
                    Erfahrungen der amerikanischen Forschungsreise initiierten Studien zu Sklaverei
                    und Plantagenwirtschaft.
